# QuickPasswordGeneratorPHP
Really simple strong-password generator for PHP projects.

### How to use?
It's really simple. Just implement this function and set up variables:
* $input = characters that will be used to generate password, if you don't need so complicated pass, feel free to use just letters and/or numbers.
* $length = it's just a length of generated password.

#### Feel free to play with this function.
